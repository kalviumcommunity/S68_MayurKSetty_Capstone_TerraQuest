## **Concept**  
This platform is inspired by [**eBird**](https://ebird.org/) and [**iNaturalist**](https://www.inaturalist.org/), built to foster interest in **[wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife)**, **[conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology)**, **[birdwatching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching)**, and **[photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography)**.  
My passion for nature and technology drove me to create a space where enthusiasts can **[log, track, and share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_journal)** their observations while contributing to conservation efforts.
 

### **Core Features:**  
üìç **Track & Log Sightings** ‚Äì Users can submit observations of birds, mammals, insects, fungi, and plants.  
üó∫Ô∏è **Trail Tracking** ‚Äì Track movement in real-time or manually plot trails and submit multiple sightings.  
üì∏ **Media Uploads & Peer Reviews** ‚Äì Users can add **images, audio, and video** to validate sightings, with community-driven **peer reviews** for accuracy.  
üèÜ **Gamified Leaderboard** ‚Äì Encourages users to explore more by ranking contributions.  
üë• **Community & Collaboration** ‚Äì Engage in discussions, plan meetups, and get feedback on wildlife photography.
